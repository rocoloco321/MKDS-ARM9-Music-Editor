Roco's Default Kart editor
======================

Edits the default kart in MKDS.

Based on Ermelber's MKDS ARM9 Music Editor.

Instructions
1. Put your (preferably decompressed) arm9.bin in the same location as the program. It must exactly be named arm9.bin
2. Open the program, it will guide you trough the editing
3. Enjoy

Note:I don't know if this work with an arm9 that isn't from the European verison of MKDS

Special thanks to Ermelber, Yami and MKDasher, without them this wouldn't be possible!
